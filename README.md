#Learning LangGraph üåê

Learning LangGraph is a project that uses knowledge graphs to capture, visualize, and analyze language structures across multiple languages. 
This repository provides tools and scripts for building interconnected graphs that help visualize relationships in vocabulary, grammar, and syntax in language learning, translation, or NLP applications.

Project Overview
The goal of Learning LangGraph is to leverage NLP and graph-based models to:

Visualize Language Relationships: Understand and explore the relationships between words, phrases, and grammatical structures.
Support Multilingual Contexts: Analyze language structures across different languages for translation and cross-lingual insights.
Enable Data-Driven Language Learning: Utilize machine learning to adapt language graphs to specific learning objectives.

Key Features
Graph-Based Representation: Build knowledge graphs representing relationships within and across languages.
Multi-Language Support: Parse and visualize data for multiple languages, ideal for translation tools and multilingual analysis.
NLP-Powered: Leverage NLP libraries to process and analyze language data.
Interactive Visualization: Explore language relationships visually with interactive graph tools.
